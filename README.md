3 contracts

1. Basic NFT ✅
2. Random IPFS NFT ✅
IPFS
- Pros: Cheap
- Cons: Someone needs to pin our data (e.g. pinata, or we host an IPFS node (and then filecoin))
3. Dynamic SVG NFT
On Chain
- Pros: the data is on chain!
- Cons: MUCH more expensivek

Going to make a dynamic NFT:
- if ETH high -> happy face
- if ETH low -> frowny face
